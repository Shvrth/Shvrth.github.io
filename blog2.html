        <h1>The Day the Crows Attacked</h1>
        <p>What started as another ordinary visit to the New Delhi Zoo quickly turned into an unforgettable adventure that I never expected. I had just finished my lunch on one of the benches near the bird sanctuary, when I noticed several house crows gathering in the trees above. At first, I didn't think much of it – after all, crows are a common sight in Delhi.</p>
        
        <p>However, my casual observation turned to concern as their numbers grew rapidly. Within minutes, there must have been at least twenty crows perched in the surrounding trees. Then, without warning, one of them swooped down toward my half-eaten sandwich. Before I could react, the entire murder of crows descended upon me in a chaotic flurry of black feathers and loud caws.</p>
        
        <p>In panic, I dropped my lunch and tried to shield my head with my arms as they dive-bombed around me. Their sharp beaks pecked at my backpack and pulled at my hair. Other zoo visitors watched in a mixture of horror and amusement as I made a mad dash toward the nearest shelter, with my avian pursuers in hot pursuit. A kind zoo keeper came to my rescue, explaining that the crows had become increasingly bold with visitors carrying food.</p>
        
        <p>Looking back, while the experience was terrifying at the moment, it's now a funny story to tell. I learned an important lesson that day: never underestimate the intelligence and determination of crows, and perhaps more importantly, never eat lunch in the open at the zoo! The incident gave me a newfound respect for these clever birds, though I now always choose to eat my lunch indoors.</p>
